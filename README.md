## 1. Filtering and Edge Detection

Description: Given standard images (grayscale and color), the following tasks are implemented:

1. Adding additive noise to the image (e.g., Uniform, Gaussian, and Salt & Pepper noise).
2. Filtering the noisy image using low-pass filters (e.g., Average, Gaussian, and Median filters).
3. Detecting edges using various edge detection masks (e.g., Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, and Canny).
4. Drawing histogram and distribution curve.
5. Equalizing the image.
6. Normalizing the image.
7. Performing local and global thresholding.
8. Transforming color image to grayscale and plot histograms of R, G, and B channels with distribution functions.
9. Applying frequency domain filters (high pass and low pass).
10. Creating hybrid images.
